# code-for-omni-wheel-robot
This is a code which is written for a mobile robot which works with ps4 joystick.
That mobile robot has forur omni wheels whose forces are diagnol when rolled compared to the straight force produced by a ordinary wheel
My code is written in such a way that input given by the joystick tells the direction and magnitude of the velocity of the robot.
I have taken the input from the joystick as horizontal and vertical components and converted into seperate velocities for each actuators which run the mobile robot so that it maintain the direction and magnitude of the velocity given by the joystick.
